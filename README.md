# **Dann Framework — Questionnaire Guide (README)**

## 📌 What is this?

The **Dann Framework** is a **question-driven software development guide** designed for **solo developers**.
Instead of jumping straight into code, it forces clarity by asking the **right questions at the right time**.

This questionnaire helps you:

* Define the real problem
* Control scope (especially for Version 1)
* Choose the right tech stack
* Avoid expensive rework
* Build software that can evolve

---

## 🎯 Who is this for?

* Solo developers
* Indie hackers
* Students
* Engineers building side projects or startups
* Anyone who tends to “code first, think later”

---

## 🧠 How to use it

1. **Start at Phase 1** — do not skip planning.
2. Answer questions **honestly and simply**.
3. Use **suggested answers as guidance**, not rules.
4. If a question feels hard, that’s a sign you need clarity.
5. Only move to coding after **Version 1 requirements are clear**.

## 🧱 Framework Structure

The questionnaire is divided into phases:

1. **Planning & Problem Definition**
2. **Requirements (SRS)**
3. **Software Design**
4. **System Modeling (UML)**
5. **Development Strategy (SDLC)**
6. **Deployment, Cost & Operations**
7. **Maintenance & Sustainability**
8. **Future Evolution**

Each phase builds on the previous one.

## ⚠️ Important Rules

* Do **not** over-design Version 1
* Write answers as if explaining to *future you*
* Skipped questions = future bugs or rewrites
* Clarity before complexity

---

## 🧪 Versioning Philosophy

* **Version 1:** Make it work
* **Version 2:** Make it better
* **Version 3:** Make it smart
* **Version 4:** Make it scale

---

## 🧩 Core Principle

> **If you can’t answer the question clearly, don’t code it yet.**
