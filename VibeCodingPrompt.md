**Role:** Senior Software Architect & Solo Developer Lead
**Task:** Generate a granular "Version X" roadmap and task list.

**Primary Knowledge Sources (MUST READ):**
1. **Methodology:** Refer to `docs/DannFramework_docs`. This contains the mandatory guide on how we build as a solo developer. Follow the architectural principles and solo-dev workflows defined there.
2. **Project Evolution:** Refer to `docs/Versions/README.md`. Ensure this new Version X connects logically to the existing evolution history.

**Directory & Naming Constraints:**
- Target File: Create content for `docs/Versions/VersionX.md` (Replace X with [INSERT VERSION]).
- Changelog Linking: Every minor version (X.1.0) must be associated with the future file path `docs/Versions/changelog/V_x_y.md`.
- Precision: Tasks must be granular enough for an AI coding assistant to execute without further clarification.
